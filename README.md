# PythonForMathematics
A series of Jupyter notebooks for those wanting to learn Python through applications to mathematics.

These notebooks are designed for Math 152 at UC Santa Cruz.  This course is meant to be an introduction to Python programming for math majors.  No previous programming experience is required.  Therefore, we start at the beginning, introducing basic data types and calculator-like computations, variables, control statements, functions, etc.  By the end, we get into numpy and some basic image manipulation.  Throughout the course, the programming applications are to undergraduate mathematics, from calculus to combinatorics to number theory and more.

These notebooks were written by [Marty Weissman](http://martyweissman.com).  Reach out with any questions or comments, especially if you would like to use these notebooks in your own courses.

## About the notebooks

## Using Google CoLab

Originally, I asked students to install Python on their computers, via Anaconda.  This time around, I'm switching to Google CoLab -- that avoids all software installation, at the cost of requiring internet access.  The notebook content will be modified a bit to fit better with CoLab.  Instructions will be added here for cloning this repository and linking with Google CoLab.
